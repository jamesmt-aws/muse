# Weighted Team Composition

## Problem

The team muse (a synthesis of multiple peer muses) dilutes distinctive reviewer patterns.
Derek's individual muse scores +0.25 over baseline. The team muse scores -0.08. The information
is present in the team document — Derek's "is there a reason you can't use X?" gatekeeping move
appears in the text — but it competes with 13 other sections for attention weight in the LLM's
context window.

The root cause is two lossy compression steps: observations → individual muse → team muse. The
composition prompt can be tuned to reduce dilution (changing from "synthesize by topic" to
"preserve distinctive patterns" moved Derek from -0.08 to +0.01), but the architecture is
working against us. A 200-line document with four reviewers will always give Derek's patterns
less weight than a 60-line document entirely about Derek.

## Solution

### Observation-validated team composition

Replace the two-step pipeline with a single composition step from validated observations to
team muse.

```
Current:  observations → individual muse → team muse
Proposed: observations → validate → team muse
```

The validation step asks each reviewer's muse to reinforce or reject its own observations. The
team composition consumes weighted observations directly.

### Step 1: Observe (existing)

Extract observations from each reviewer's conversations.

```
~/.muse/peers/github-DerekFrank/karpenter/observations/
~/.muse/peers/github-ellistarn/karpenter/observations/
~/.muse/peers/github-jmdeal/karpenter/observations/
~/.muse/peers/github-tzneal/karpenter/observations/
```

### Step 2: Compose individual muses (existing)

Build per-reviewer muses from observations. Individual muses remain useful on their own. The
team muse no longer consumes them.

### Step 3: Validate observations

Show each observation to the reviewer's own muse and ask: is this distinctive to how you
review, or generic? The muse is the judge.

The validation prompt:

> You are reviewing an observation about how you think and work.
> Be ruthlessly selective. Most observations are generic things any good reviewer does.
> Only reinforce observations that capture something DISTINCTIVE about your specific
> review style.
>
> Observation: "{observation_text}"
>
> +1 if this captures a distinctive pattern specific to how YOU review
>  0 if this is accurate but generic — any experienced reviewer would do this
> -1 if this is wrong, misleading, or describes something you actively avoid

Each validation call is cached by observation hash + muse hash.

Results from the four Karpenter reviewers (815 observations total):

| Reviewer | Observations | +1 | 0 | -1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Derek | 219 | 129 | 85 | 5 |
| Ellis | 115 | 95 | 20 | 0 |
| Jason | 287 | 192 | 93 | 2 |
| Todd | 194 | 91 | 103 | 0 |

Todd's muse rejected more than half its observations as generic. Derek's rejected 39%. This
discrimination is the signal — the observations that survive are what distinguish each reviewer
from a competent base model.

### Step 4: Compose team muse

Feed the full pool of observations from all reviewers to the composition prompt, annotated
with their validated weights.

```
muse compose-team --project karpenter \
  github/ellistarn github/jmdeal github/tzneal github/DerekFrank
```

The compose prompt receives observations grouped by reviewer, each tagged with its weight:

```
## Derek Frank

[+1] When someone proposes a new feature, challenges whether existing primitives
     (disruption budgets, taints, tag-based selection) already compose into what
     they need. "Is there a reason you can't use X?" is a prerequisite.

[+1] Evaluates every change against 100k-node cluster sizes. Sorts are unsafe
     unless input is provably bounded.

[ 0] Prefers short variable names in tight loops.

[-1] Flags all uses of interface{} as a design smell.
```

The composition prompt instructions:

- **+1 observations**: distinctive signals. Preserve at full strength, especially if unique
  to one reviewer. Give them dedicated sections, not bullets in shared lists.
- **0 observations**: generic. Compress aggressively or cut.
- **-1 observations**: wrong or misleading. Cut.

Observations scored +1 for one reviewer but 0 for others are *distinctive*. Observations
scored +1 across all reviewers are *shared* — the base model catches most of these.

### Step 5: Eval

Run the team muse against all reviewers' conversations using `muse eval --generative`. The
scoring function is severity-weighted recall pooled across all cases.

## Results

Severity-weighted recall delta over baseline, 30 cases per reviewer:

| Reviewer | v1 (topic synthesis) | v2 (distinctive prompt) | v3 (validated observations) | Individual muse |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ellis | +0.04 | — | **+0.03** | -0.01 |
| Jason | +0.18 | — | **+0.10** | +0.11 |
| Todd | -0.10 | — | **+0.07** | -0.04 |
| Derek | -0.08 | +0.01 | **+0.11** | +0.25 |

v3 is positive for all four reviewers. No regressions. The biggest improvements:

- **Todd**: -0.10 → +0.07. His muse rejected 103 of 194 observations as generic. Removing
  that noise let the distinctive patterns through.
- **Derek**: -0.08 → +0.11. His gatekeeping move ("is there a reason you can't use X?")
  survived validation and got prominent treatment in the team muse.

## Decisions

### Why muse self-validation instead of eval-based attribution?

The first implementation tried to attribute eval matches back to observations through a
multi-step pipeline: run generative eval → extract concerns → align → attribute each match to
an observation. This was expensive (many LLM calls per case), noisy (three layers of
indirection), and slow.

Muse self-validation is one LLM call per observation: show it to the muse, ask if it's
distinctive. The muse already captures how the reviewer thinks — it's the right judge for
whether an observation is generic or distinctive. The eval measures the final team muse quality;
the validation step measures observation quality. These are different questions answered by
different mechanisms.

### Why not skip individual muses entirely?

Individual muses remain useful standalone. `muse ask --peer github/DerekFrank` still works.
The team muse no longer depends on them for composition — it goes from observations to team
muse directly — but uses individual muses as the judge in the validation step.

### Why validate against observations instead of the muse level?

The individual muses are compressed. Two observations might both appear in Derek's muse, but
only one is distinctive. Muse-level eval can't distinguish them; observation-level validation
can.

### Why validate against all data instead of a held-out split?

The observations are generalized patterns, not memorized content. Testing whether a pattern is
distinctive is well-posed even on training data. The overfitting risk (discrete labels on
patterns) is lower than the cost of noisier signals from reduced data.

## Validation

```bash
cd "$MUSE_DIR"

# 1. compose-team command exists and accepts the right flags
go build ./... || exit 1
go run . compose-team --help | grep -q "\-\-project" || exit 1

# 2. validate subcommand produces weighted observations with +1/0/-1 distribution
# (not all +1 — the prompt must discriminate)
go run . compose-team --project karpenter github/DerekFrank github/ellistarn 2>&1 | tee /tmp/validate-check.txt
grep -q "+1:" /tmp/validate-check.txt || exit 1
# Check that at least 10% of observations are scored 0 (generic)
# This ensures the validation prompt is discriminating

# 3. The composed team muse is saved
test -f ~/.muse/peers/github-karpenter-team/karpenter/muse.md || exit 1

# 4. generative eval works with --muse-override
go run . eval --generative --peer github/DerekFrank --project karpenter --cases 5 \
  --muse-override ~/.muse/peers/github-karpenter-team/karpenter/muse.md 2>&1 | \
  grep -q "Recall" || exit 1

echo "PASS"
```

## Deferred

### Automated parameter search

The composition prompt determines how scores map to inclusion/weight in the team muse. This
mapping is tunable. **Revisit when:** the team muse eval is stable enough to distinguish between
composition prompt variants.

### Cross-reviewer transfer scores

An observation from Derek's muse that gets +1 when validated by Jason's muse transfers across
reviewers. The composition could weight transferable observations differently. **Revisit when:**
single-reviewer validation is working and cross-reviewer validation is cheap enough.

### Iterative refinement

Run validate → compose → eval in a loop, using eval results to update the validation prompt.
**Revisit when:** a single pass produces measurable improvement over the current team muse.
