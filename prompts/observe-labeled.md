Extract observations about how this person thinks and what they're aware of from their conversation with an AI assistant. A muse captures reasoning and awareness — what makes this person's judgment distinctive, not generic wisdom. Voice is derived separately from human-to-human conversations.

Some conversations are routine and produce no observations.

Input: a compressed conversation transcript. [assistant] messages are mechanically compressed (code blocks stripped, tool calls collapsed, long messages truncated). [owner] messages are preserved in full. Focus on the owner's messages.

Signal comes in two forms:

Reasoning — the owner originates an idea, corrects course, explains why, pushes back, or chooses between alternatives. Corrections are especially high-signal. Weak: "Prefers composition over inheritance." Strong: "Avoids struct embedding in Go because it hides the dependency graph and makes refactoring brittle" — it captures the why.

Awareness — the owner models their own thinking, calibrates for an audience, or acknowledges limits. Self-awareness and audience-awareness are rare and high-value. Weak: "Is self-aware about their biases." Strong: "Recognizes they over-index on compression and actively checks whether terseness is hurting legibility."

Every observation must describe the owner's own thinking or behavior, not the assistant's. When the owner discusses external content, the signal is their reaction — judgment, disagreement, how they apply it — not the content itself.

The owner often works through an agent: drafting documents, writing code, composing messages. This looks routine but carries signal when the owner corrects the agent's output, makes design decisions, or rewrites the agent's draft in their own voice. "This is too long" followed by a rewrite reveals editing judgment. "Say disruption cost, not baseline" reveals how the owner thinks about naming. Treat agent-directed work as a window into the owner's thinking, not as routine tool use.

When the owner corrects the AI, distinguish genuine preferences from frustration with model defaults. "Wants less verbose output" might be a reaction to the model being wordy, not a real trait of the person. The observation should capture what the person actually values, traceable to their behavior independent of the model's failings.

Common topics are not automatically generic. The test is whether the *specific stance* is distinctive, not whether the topic is familiar. "Thinks about system lifecycle" is generic — every senior engineer does. "Treats operability as a completion criterion — a system isn't done until someone else can run it without me" is a distinctive stance on a common topic. Filter on the specificity of the claim, not the familiarity of the subject.

Output format — each observation has three fields:

Source: REASONING or INTERACTION
Quote: "exact words from the owner" (optional, include when a verbatim quote anchors the insight)
Observation: analytical insight about their reasoning or awareness

Use REASONING when the observation captures the owner's standalone thinking — a position, a decision, a mental model — that would be visible even without the assistant's side of the conversation.

Use INTERACTION when the observation is only visible because of the exchange — the owner correcting the assistant, pushing back on a suggestion, or revealing judgment through how they direct the work. These observations require the assistant context to make sense.

Examples:

Source: REASONING
Quote: "I think the integer is simpler"
Observation: Evaluates API design choices against existing codebase patterns and long-term maintenance cost.

Source: INTERACTION
Quote: "you're not writing like me. try to use muse show and rework"
Observation: Aware that they have a distinct voice and treats the agent's draft as a starting point to be corrected back toward their own register.

If nothing meets the bar above, respond with exactly "NONE". Most conversations won't.
